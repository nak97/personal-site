    <h3>MMA</h3>
<p>
  Mixed Martial Arts is a great combat sport to watch. It takes a lot of hard work, discipline, and strength to be successful at it. Bruce Lee is considered by many to be the Father of MMA by being one of the 
  first fighters to not stick to one specific martial arts. He once said “be like water, when water enters a cup it becomes the cup.” He incorporated this into his practice by being adaptive. He combined many techniques into one and 
  used that to make his movies more realistic. Unfortunately Bruce lees untimely death at an age of only 32, he would go down in history as having been the first to publicize adaptive fighting techniques becoming the father of MMA.

  <h3> Basic Rules  </h3>
  <p>MMA has alot of rules that are designed to protect the fighters from unecessary injury or immediate lethal contact that could lead to permanent injury or death. 
    It makes sense to have so many rules due to the nature of the sport. It is classified as a combat sport which is one above full contact. While the purpose of full contact sports is not necesarrily to 
  cause harm to the opposing player but rather to add an extra level of difficulty and skill by allowing physical contact to occur. In MMA theres only one purpose, to win by beating your opponent into submission. Here are a few of the rules. 
For starters when it comes to equipment, everyone is required to wear gloves and other equipment that have lycra in it. It is against the rules to grab someones fingers. It is also against the rules to hit an opponent in the back of the head, neck, the throat, spine or to the intimate parts. 
Which makes sense because if these parts of the body were allowed to be hit, it would essentially be like gladiators fighting to the death, and that would be a lot less popular to participate in or to watch. You also cant pinch, grab or tear your opponents skin. If you are standing
you cant kick, stomp or bring the tip of your elbow down onto them. There is also a point system that serves as a moderator to determine who wins if neither competitor knocks the other out. Its based on how many penalties they get. So While it seems like MMA is a lawless anything goes sport it is 
much more sophisticated than people think. It certainly is brutal, and certainly is not for everyone.     </p>

        Butterbean (on the left) is a well known boxer/mma fighter. He fought much better as a boxer due to how limiting the contact rules are. His punches were like freight trains knocking many people out in the first round. When he tried MMA he quickly learned how powerful a standing kick to the head is. This was the most common way to knock him out.

      Getting punched in the face is very common in MMA. Many of the fighters eventually receive permanent brain injuries from the many concussions they could get. Some have even died in the ring. However thanks to the rules death in the ring is a rare thing and it only happens a few times a year. I was pretty surprised to find that out.
