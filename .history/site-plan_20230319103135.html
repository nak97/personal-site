        What makes my site unique is the fact that it’s dedicated to not only watching greatest hits highlights But also has some basic information to help someone who has little to no experience either playing the sport, or watching it which means its easier to understand what is going on because we all know how confusing sports can be when due to how fast paced they are. 
        Life can be a drag sometimes and you just need to relax and unwind, perhaps grab a snack, 
        sit back click a few links and you will have enough entertainment to keep you busy for long enough to recover from the rigors of life and get back to business.

        Why people will come to my sight?
        What my site has to offer is something unique. I have yet to find a website that is dedicated purely to watching these types of videos.
        While it is true that youtube has thousands of these sort of videos, they also have millions of other videos on an infinite number of subjects. Youtube and others sites 
        like it fall under the category of if you can think it, its there.

      <h3>Lacrosse</h3>
  <p>
    Lacrosse is a fun sport to play, I enjoyed it in Highschool and I will never forget the way it felt to knock someone out and have their whole team trying to take me down. 
    Unfortunately it wasn't recorded but that is what inspired me to have a page that is dedicated to nothing but watching some good ole highlights from a very under-rated sport. 
    One thing that I really like about lacrosse is the fact that it is an Original American sport. The Ancient Americans would play this sport to please the Great Creator, or God. 
    The name lacrosse is a French name which means cross. That is the name given by French colonizers because in their eyes the sticks that were used back then looked like wooden crosses. 
    Lacrosse was played for several other reasons as well, including settling disputes with other tribes or bets, as well as to condition young warriors for combat.
     When it was played it was a big event. It has been said that these games had over a thousand players, and the goal posts could range from 400 yards apart to well over two miles, it probably depended on how many players there were.  
  </p>

  <h3> Basic Rules  </h3>
  <p>Just like any other sport there are some basic rules designed to promote fairness. While lacrosse is considered a full contact sport, its generally looked down upon to just full on tackle someone and is illegal. If you were caught by a ref it would be a instant flag followed by a snide remark such as "this ain't football son". With that being said it still happens a lot. The basic premace of the game is to score on the other team. The size of the field is 110 yards, you are allowed to go behind the goal. Each team consists of a goalie and three defense men, 3 middies and three attack men. The defense men carry 6 foot long lacrosse sticks while everyone else carries 3 foot long sticks.The only ones that have free range to roam around the field are the middies. The attack men must stay on their side and same with the defense men. When you hit someone it is illegal to lead with your shoulder. The proper way to check someone is to use your stick with your hands side by side with no gap in between. Below are some examples of what not to do.   </p>

      <h3>MMA</h3>
     <p>
  Mixed Martial Arts is a great combat sport to watch. It takes a lot of hard work, discipline, and strength to be successful at it. Bruce Lee is considered by many to be the Father of MMA by being one of the 
  first fighters to not stick to one specific martial arts. He once said “be like water, when water enters a cup it becomes the cup.” He incorporated this into his practice by being adaptive. He combined many techniques into one and 
  used that to make his movies more realistic. Unfortunately Bruce lees untimely death at an age of only 32, he would go down in history as having been the first to publicize adaptive fighting techniques becoming the father of MMA. 
</p>

<h3> Basic Rules  </h3>
  <p>MMA has a lot of rules that are designed to protect the fighters from unecessary injury or immediate lethal contact that could lead to permanent injury or death. 
    It makes sense to have so many rules due to the nature of the sport. It is classified as a combat sport which is one above full contact. While the purpose of full contact sports is not necesarrily to 
  cause harm to the opposing player but rather to add an extra level of difficulty and skill by allowing physical contact to occur. In MMA theres only one purpose, to win by beating your opponent into submission. Here are a few of the rules. 
For starters when it comes to equipment, everyone is required to wear gloves and other equipment that have lycra in it. It is against the rules to grab someones fingers. It is also against the rules to hit an opponent in the back of the head, neck, the throat, spine or to the intimate parts. 
Which makes sense because if these parts of the body were allowed to be hit, it would essentially be like gladiators fighting to the death, and that would be a lot less popular to participate in or to watch. You also cant pinch, grab or tear your opponents skin. If you are standing
you cant kick, stomp or bring the tip of your elbow down onto them. There is also a point system that serves as a moderator to determine who wins if neither competitor knocks the other out. Its based on how many penalties they get. So While it seems like MMA is a lawless anything goes sport it is 
much more sophisticated than people think. It certainly is brutal, and certainly is not for everyone.     </p>

      <h3>Football</h3>
      <p>
        American Football not to be confused with football, a different sport entirely, is the most watched sport in the United States. It is found in most middle and high schools all over the nation and generates billions in revenue. 
        Not only is it fun to watch but if your team manages to not only make it to the super bowl but win it then you will carry with you a certain pride that will last you until the start of the next season. Football has its beginnings in the late 19th century. Initially it was a crude combination of two of the most popular Eurpeon sports at the time, Rugby and soccer.
        it was only played by the most prestigous universities in the country such as yale and harvard. Eventually people started to really enjoy it and before long the first football association was formed.  In the 1920's the National Football League was created and it eventually merged with the first American Football Association creating the NFL. 
        Here are some videos of some of the most insane hits that I could find on the internet.
      </p>
      <h3> Basic Rules  </h3>
      <p>The basics of football are very commonly known, you have two opposing teams each with 11 players on the field. There are many different positions. The most prominent is the quarter back 
        who calls the shots. He initially handles the ball and can do many things with it. He can throw it while the linemen are defending him, 
        he can hand it off for a running play or he him self can also run the ball down the field and score a touchdown should he have the opportunity. Football is a full contact sport and you can hit people as hard 
        as you possibly can, without punching or kicking. You can not grab someones helmet and throw them to the ground. in football you are taught to lead with your shoulder when you tackle someone, if done other wise 
        you can seriously injure your neck and spine causing you perminant life altering damage. The most common injury in Football is a concussion. If close enough to a goal post you can kick the ball and score 3 points. However this does not apply if you
        just scored a touchdown. If you scored a touchdown you can kick a field goal for an additional 1 point or you can run the ball into the end zone for an additional two point conversion.   </p>
