      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        What makes my site unique is the fact that it’s dedicated to nothing other than watching highlights. 
        Life can be a drag sometimes and you just need to relax and unwind, perhaps grab a snack, 
        sit back click a few links and you will have enough entertainment to keep you busy for long enough to recover from the rigors of life and get back to business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why people will come to my sight?
        What my site has to offer is something unique. I have yet to find a website that is dedicated purely to watching these types of videos.
        While it is true that youtube has thousands of these sort of videos, they also have millions of other videos on an infinite number of subjects. Youtube and other sites 
        like it fall under the catagory of if you can think it, its there.

      <h3>Lacrosse</h3>
      <p>
        Lacrosse is a fun sport to play, I enjoyed it in Highschool and I will never forget the way it felt to knock someone out and have their whole team trying to take me down. 
        Unfortunately it wasn’t recorded but that is what inspired me to have a page that is dedicated to nothing but watching some good ole highlights from a very under-rated sport. 
        One thing that I really like about lacrosse is the fact that it is an Original American sport. The Ancient Americans would play this sport to please the Great Creator, or God. 
        The name lacrosse is a French name which means cross. That is the name given by French colonizers because in their eyes the sticks that were used back then looked like wooden crosses. 
        Lacrosse was played for several other reasons as well, including settling disputes with other tribes or bets, as well as to condition young warriors for combat.
         When it was played it was a big event. It has been said that these games had over a thousand players, and the goal posts could range from 400 yards apart to well over two miles, it probably depended on how many players there were.

      </ul>
      <h3>MMA</h3>
      <p>
        Mixed Martial Arts is a great combat sport to watch. It takes a lot of hard work, discipline, and strength to be successful at it. Bruce Lee is considered by many to be the Father of MMA by being one of the 
        first fighters to not stick to one specific martial arts. He once said “be like water, when water enters a cup it becomes the cup.” He incorporated this into his practice by being adaptive. He combined many techniques into one and 
        used that to make his movies more realistic. Unfortunately Bruce lees untimely death at an age of only 32, he would go down in history as having been the first to publicize adaptive fighting techniques becoming the father of MMA.

      </ul>
      <h3>Football</h3>
      <p>
        American Football not to be confused with football, a different sport entirely, is the most watched sport in the United States. It is found in most middle and high schools all over the nation and generates  billions in revenue. 
        Not only is it fun to watch but if your team manages to not only make it to the super bowl win it then you will carry with you a certain pride that will last you until the start of the next season. 
        Here are some videos of some of the most insane hits that I could find on the internet.
