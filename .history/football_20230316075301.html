  <h3>Football</h3>
      <p>
        American Football not to be confused with football, a different sport entirely, is the most watched sport in the United States. It is found in most middle and high schools all over the nation and generates  billions in revenue. 
        Not only is it fun to watch but if your team manages to not only make it to the super bowl win it then you will carry with you a certain pride that will last you until the start of the next season. 
        Here are some videos of some of the most insane hits that I could find on the internet.
