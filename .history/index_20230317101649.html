        What makes my site unique is the fact that itâ€™s dedicated to nothing other than watching highlights. 
        Life can be a drag sometimes and you just need to relax and unwind, perhaps grab a snack, 
        sit back click a few links and you will have enough entertainment to keep you busy for long enough to recover from the rigors of life and get back to business.

        Why people will come to my sight?
        What my site has to offer is something unique. I have yet to find a website that is dedicated purely to watching these types of videos.
        While it is true that youtube has thousands of these sort of videos, they also have millions of other videos on an infinite number of subjects. Youtube and other sites 
        like it fall under the catagory of if you can think it, its there.
