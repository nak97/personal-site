  <h3>Lacrosse</h3>
  <p>
    Lacrosse is a fun sport to play, I enjoyed it in Highschool and I will never forget the way it felt to knock someone out and have their whole team trying to take me down. 
    Unfortunately it wasn't recorded but that is what inspired me to have a page that is dedicated to nothing but watching some good ole highlights from a very under-rated sport. 
    One thing that I really like about lacrosse is the fact that it is an Original American sport. The Ancient Americans would play this sport to please the Great Creator, or God. 
    The name lacrosse is a French name which means cross. That is the name given by French colonizers because in their eyes the sticks that were used back then looked like wooden crosses. 
    Lacrosse was played for several other reasons as well, including settling disputes with other tribes or bets, as well as to condition young warriors for combat.
     When it was played it was a big event. It has been said that these games had over a thousand players, and the goal posts could range from 400 yards apart to well over two miles, it probably depended on how many players there were.

  <h3> Basic Rules  </h3>
  <p>Just like any other sport there are some basic rules designed to promote fairness. While lacrosse is considered a full contact sport, its generally looked down upon to just full on tackle someone and is illegal. If you were caught by a ref it would be a instant flag followed by a snide remark such as "this ain't football son". With that being said it still happens a lot. The basic premace of the game is to score on the other team. The size of the field is 110 yards, you are allowed to go behind the goal. Each team consists of a goalie and three defense men, 3 middies and three attack men. The defense men carry 6 foot long lacrosse sticks while everyone else carries 3 foot long sticks.The only ones that have free range to roam around the field are the middies. The attack men must stay on their side and same with the defense men. When you hit someone it is illegal to lead with your shoulder. The proper way to check someone is to use your stick with your hands side by side with no gap in between. Below are some examples of what not to do.   </p>

        In this example the guy with the ball is performing an illegal action called warding, which means he has his free hand up in a protective stance and he even used it to counter attack the opposing player and knocking him over.

      This is also very illegal, it looks like the guy doing the hitting used correct form but what makes it illegal is he hit him high, you are only supposed to check someone center mass, unless you are just using your stick to get the ball, then you can hit anywhere in between the neck and lower waist.
