    <h3>Football</h3>
      <p>
        American Football not to be confused with football, a different sport entirely, is the most watched sport in the United States. It is found in most middle and high schools all over the nation and generates billions in revenue. 
        Not only is it fun to watch but if your team manages to not only make it to the super bowl but win it then you will carry with you a certain pride that will last you until the start of the next season. Football has its beginnings in the late 19th century. Initially it was a crude combination of two of the most popular Eurpeon sports at the time, Rugby and soccer.
        it was only played by the most prestigous universities in the country such as yale and harvard. Eventually people started to really enjoy it and before long the first football association was formed.  In the 1920's the National Football League was created and it eventually merged with the first American Football Association creating the NFL. 
        Here are some videos of some of the most insane hits that I could find on the internet.

    <h3> Basic Rules  </h3>
    <p>The basics of football are very commonly known, you have two opposing teams each with 11 players on the field. There are many different positions. The most prominent is the quarter back 
      who calls the shots. He initially handles the ball and can do many things with it. He can throw it while the linemen are defending him, 
      he can hand it off for a running play or he him self can also run the ball down the field and score a touchdown should he have the opportunity. Football is a full contact sport and you can hit people as hard 
      as you possibly can, without punching or kicking. You can not grab someones helmet and throw them to the ground. in football you are taught to lead with your shoulder when you tackle someone, if done other wise 
      you can seriously injure your neck and spine causing you perminant life altering damage. The most common injury in Football is a concussion. If close enough to a goal post you can kick the ball and score 3 points. However this does not apply if you
      just scored a touchdown. If you scored a touchdown you can kick a field goal for an additional 1 point or you can run the ball into the end zone for an additional two point conversion.   </p>

          Football requires only the strongest athletes in order to win a game. Here we see that two men are attempting to tackle a single man who has the ball. This happens often and it totally legal.

        One thing that most high level athletes have is an incredible ability to jump. Players in football jump over each other all the time because sometimes its better to go up and over someone than to try to go through them.
