  <h3>MMA</h3>
      <p>
        Mixed Martial Arts is a great combat sport to watch. It takes a lot of hard work, discipline, and strength to be successful at it. Bruce Lee is considered by many to be the Father of MMA by being one of the 
        first fighters to not stick to one specific martial arts. He once said “be like water, when water enters a cup it becomes the cup.” He incorporated this into his practice by being adaptive. He combined many techniques into one and 
        used that to make his movies more realistic. Unfortunately Bruce lees untimely death at an age of only 32, he would go down in history as having been the first to publicize adaptive fighting techniques becoming the father of MMA.
