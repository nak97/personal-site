    <h3>Football</h3>
      <p>
        American Football not to be confused with football, a different sport entirely, is the most watched sport in the United States. It is found in most middle and high schools all over the nation and generates  billions in revenue. 
        Not only is it fun to watch but if your team manages to not only make it to the super bowl win it then you will carry with you a certain pride that will last you until the start of the next season. 
        Here are some videos of some of the most insane hits that I could find on the internet.

    <h3> Basic Rules  </h3>
    <p>Just like any other sport there are some basic rules designed to promote fairness. While lacrosse is considered a full contact sport, its generally looked down upon to just full on tackle someone and is illegal. If you were caught by a ref it would be a instant flag followed by a snide remark such as "this ain't football son". With that being said it still happens a lot. The basic premace of the game is to score on the other team. The size of the field is 110 yards, you are allowed to go behind the goal. Each team consists of a goalie and three defense men, 3 middies and three attack men. The defense men carry 6 foot long lacrosse sticks while everyone else carries 3 foot long sticks.The only ones that have free range to roam around the field are the middies. The attack men must stay on their side and same with the defense men. When you hit someone it is illegal to lead with your shoulder. The proper way to check someone is to use your stick with your hands side by side with no gap in between. Below are some examples of what not to do.   </p>

          In this example the guy with the ball is performing an illegal action called warding, which means he has his free hand up in a protective stance and he even used it to counter attack the opposing player and knocking him over.

      <p>
        This is also very illegal, it looks like the guy doing the hitting used correct form but what makes it illegal is he hit him high, you are only supposed to check someone center mass, unless you are just using your stick to get the ball, then you can hit anywhere in between the neck and lower waist.
